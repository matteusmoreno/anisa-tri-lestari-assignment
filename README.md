* **Contact:** Contact form and location information.

## Features

* **Testimonials:** Display of testimonials from clients or colleagues.
* **Contact Form:** Form that allows visitors to send messages directly to Anisa Tri Lestari.
* **Map:** Integration of a map (iframe) to display the location.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on mobile and desktop devices.
* **Animations/Interactions:** Use of JavaScript to add interactivity, such as the functionality to toggle the display of contact information in the sidebar and the display of testimonial modals.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Page structure.
* **CSS:** Page styling (style.css file - *not included in this README*).
* **JavaScript:** Interactivity and DOM manipulation (script.js file).
* **Icons:** [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) for icons.
* **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Poppins).
* **Deployment:** Vercel.

## Usage Instructions

1.  Clone the repository (if available).
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## CSS Considerations

The `style.css` file contains all the styling for the portfolio. Due to its size, it is not included in this README. It is essential for the site's appearance and should be kept in the `assets/css/` folder.

## Future Improvements

* Add more projects to the portfolio.
* Implement a backend to process the contact form (currently uses FormSubmit).
* Optimize page performance.
* Add more complex animations.
* Implement automated tests.
